# CryptoCastle — fixed for GitHub Pages

- Links that previously pointed to `https://glassblade.co.uk/castle/...` are now **relative**.
- Missing internal pages have been stubbed with simple placeholders so links won't 404.
- Publish steps:
  1) Create public repo `cryptocastle` on GitHub.
  2) Upload the contents of this folder (not the folder itself).
  3) Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / (root).
  4) Visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/cryptocastle/`.
